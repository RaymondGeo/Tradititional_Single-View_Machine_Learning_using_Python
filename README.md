# Tradititional_Single-View_Machine_Learning_using_Python

Automated Python-based Machine Learning Framework for Prediction

A comprehensive and modular Python framework for training, tuning, evaluating, and comparing multiple regression algorithmsâ€”including KNN, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and Neural Networksâ€”on tabular datasets. 

Pipeline Features:

âœ… Automated training across multiple train-test splits (70%â€“95%)

ðŸ§ª 5-fold cross-validation with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

ðŸ“ˆ Composite Score (balanced RÂ² and RMSE) for fair model ranking

ðŸ“Š Feature importance analysis using permutation methods

ðŸ“‘ Auto-generated performance reports (.docx) and comparison plots

ðŸ”„ Data normalization and denormalization for real-scale predictions

ðŸ“¦ Support for Excel inputs and outputs for easy integration
